"""Quoin install roundtrip (IT-002, FR-003-AC-5): the module installs into
Quoin with the semantic
contract, and the operator's prior module state is restored unconditionally.

This row is a **Demonstration**: no released Quoin carries the semantic
installer (`agent-ix/quoin` main `3e842ce`, no tag contains it), and the
install mutates the operator's global `quoin module` store. It therefore runs
only when both are true:

* a Quoin whose `module install` understands `path:` is on `PATH`, and
* `QUOIN_INSTALL_ROUNDTRIP=1` is set, which is the operator saying "you may
  touch my global module store".

The restore step runs whether or not the install succeeded (IT-002-SC-06).
